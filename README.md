# A-Metasurface-Enabled-TEMPEST-Countermeasure-Based-on-Amplitude-and-Phase-Joint-Modulation
Repository for simulation scripts and experimental results. Images are reconstructed using an envelope-demodulation-based TEMPEST algorithm.

To facilitate reproducibility and further analysis, the raw HDMI electromagnetic leakage signals acquired using software-defined radio (SDR) during the experiments are publicly available on Google Drive:
